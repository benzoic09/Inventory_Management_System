### Environment Setup

**Install Python**
To begin, you'll need a working Python installation on your computer. You can go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ to obtain it for your PC/Mac. The instructions for installing it are available on the official Python website.

**Install Git**
Git is a popular version control system that keeps track of changes you make to your code, which is handy when you want to revert to a previous version, especially after a mistake. Additionally, Git helps us push our code to online code hosting services such as GitHub and GitLab, enabling developers to collaborate on a project.

**Install Django**
Once you have installed Python and Git, create a folder named "inventory-management-system" anywhere on your machine. Change to the "inventory" folder, then right-click and select "Git Bash Here". A Git Bash will open in the "inventory" folder.

**Create a virtual environment:**
Type python -m venv env. This command creates a virtual environment named "env" where we will install the project's dependencies.

**Install and trial**
After installing Git, Django, and Python, you can clone the repository at [repository URL]. Additionally, you can set up a virtual environment and activate it before cloning the repository to ensure a clean and isolated development environment. This will provide you with access to the complete inventory management system solution, allowing you to seamlessly integrate it into your organization's workflow and begin efficiently managing your inventory.


### Usage
