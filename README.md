**Inventory Management System**

Inventory, also known as stock, refers to goods a business owns, sells, or uses in production.

An inventory management system, also known as inventory management software, is a computer system that helps manage inventory. It facilitates tasks such as keeping stock levels, issuing and receiving stock, and many other related tasks.

I**ntroduction**

Organizations always require an efficient method to track and manage the diverse array of devices they possess. In response to this need, we have developed a streamlined solution tailored to simplify this task. Our inventory management tool provides a comprehensive platform for organizations to monitor, track, and manage their inventory effectively. With intuitive features designed to enhance operational efficiency, our tool empowers organizations to maintain precise records of their devices, optimize stock levels, and streamline inventory operations seamlessly.

**Environment Setup**

# Install Python
To begin, you'll need a working Python installation on your computer. You can go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ to obtain it for your PC/Mac. The instructions for installing it are available on the official Python website.

Install Git
Git is a popular version control system that keeps track of changes you make to your code, which is handy when you want to revert to a previous version, especially after a mistake. Additionally, Git helps us push our code to online code hosting services such as GitHub and GitLab, enabling developers to collaborate on a project.

In addition to tracking changes in our code, Git on Windows allows you to use commands such as ls, execute bash scripts, etc., making development easier.

You can obtain Git at https://git-scm.com/downloads. Instructions for installation are available on the site as well.

Install Django

Once you have installed Python and Git, create a folder named "inventory-management-system" anywhere on your machine. Change to the "inventory" folder, then right-click and select "Git Bash Here". A Git Bash will open in the "inventory" folder.

Create a virtual environment:

Type python -m venv env. This command creates a virtual environment named "env" where we will install the project's dependencies.

Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:
shell
Copy code
$ env\Scripts\activate

On Linux/Mac:
shell
Copy code
$ source /env/bin/activate
Install Django:

ruby
Copy code
$ pip install django~=4.0.0
Install Django crispy form, which integrates Django nicely with Bootstrap:

ruby
Copy code
$ pip install Django-crispy-forms~=2.0
$ pip install crispy-bootstrap5~=0.7
Now that we have installed all the required packages, we can start using our system.


The Structure of the Django Application
The coverage of the ins and outs of the project is well covered in the YouTube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zh3wpgLH-U.


Install and trial

After installing Git, Django, and Python, you can clone the repository at [repository URL]. Additionally, you can set up a virtual environment and activate it before cloning the repository to ensure a clean and isolated development environment. This will provide you with access to the complete inventory management system solution, allowing you to seamlessly integrate it into your organization's workflow and begin efficiently managing your inventory.
